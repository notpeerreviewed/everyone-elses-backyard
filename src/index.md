A blog about data science.

Here's a few notes for my own benefit about things that I want to write about once this blog is properly up and running:

- Update my RDCOMClient series from my previous blog
  - add my realisation about writing character vectors separately to numeric vectors to preserve data type at the target document
- posts about techniques learned at MoE including data modelling, propensity score matching, mixed models
- governance processes for data systems
- SQL stuff including:
  - CTEs, recursive queries, date range operations
- R stuff like glue and glue_sql
  - especially parameterising sql queries from within R
- thoughts about data visualisation including:
  - pros and cons of different tools like PowerBI vs Shiny, vs D3
  - building capability in an organisation
  - value of building engaging visualisations over simple dashboards
- importance of data literacy for non-data professionals

- Procrastination - importance of starting
- Not giving up on yourself
- Importance of writing for coders

- The importance of allowing yourself to be wrong and to let others see it.


Things I'll need for this site:

- base njk template
- navigation template
  - homepage / about me
  - code snippets
  - posts
  - data visualisations
- simple post template that includes code snippet formatting
- template for full page data visualisations

```r
test code highlighting
```
